Kyle Zatyko originally traced axons on FWNGV. He shared series and trace files with Lyndsey to trace the 
axons designated to curate:
d01cfa05
d02cfa13
d02cfa23
d02cfa28
d03cfa13
d03cfa17
d03cfa36
d04cfa14
d04cfa22
d04cfa26
All of the above axons have been traced by both Lyndsey and Kyle, and are designated with a KZ_ or LMK_ prepended to the azon name to differentiate them. 


The information for these axons are in the xlsx sheet currently labeled 
"LastModifiedDate"_CA1AxonBoutonStory, under curation tab. This information is used to calculate the CV between tracers


Lyndsey edited/ curated all boutons, vesicles, and PSDs (with Patrick Parkers help adding new PSD cfa traces to multisynaptic boutons)
